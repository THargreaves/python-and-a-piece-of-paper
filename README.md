# Python and a Piece of Paper

_Presentation and code for the 2020 WFS talk 'Python and a Piece of Paper'_

The talk discuss the power of using Python for Data Science, specifically within finance. This is centred around a short (restricted to one page of A4) Python workflow which can predict whether an application for a credit card will be approved with reasonable accuracy.

An interactive notebook to run the code for yourself (without needing to install/setup Python) can be found at [http://bit.ly/credit-card-applications](http://bit.ly/credit-card-applications).
